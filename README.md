### build Multi-Regression model using sklearn LinearRegression for predecting yearly amount spent using features : {Avg. Session Length , Time on App , Time on Website , Length of Membership}
### Steps : 

  - first making EDA (Explortary Data Analysis) for analysing the data and understanding it .
    
  - second using seaborn to visualize the data and understand the relations between the all features .
    
  - then training the model on the data using sklearn LinearRegression that use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) algorithm.
    
  - measure the error persentage using this functions :
    - mean_absolute_error
    - mean_squared_error
    - r2_score
    - explained_variance_score
    - max_error
    - mean_absolute_percentage_error
    - median_absolute_error
